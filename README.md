# Multiclassification and model deployment
## Food Type Classification with Deep Learning üçïü•óüç£

### Overview
This project focuses on the **multiclass classification** of food types using advanced deep learning architectures, including **EfficientNet** and **Vision Transformer (ViT)**. The objective is to accurately detect and classify various food items in images and deploy the trained models as interactive applications.

### Key Features
- **Multiclass Classification**: The model can recognize and classify multiple food types, suitable for various applications.
- **Model Deployment**: 
  - **Gradio**: Create an interactive web application that allows users to upload images and receive instant food type classifications.
  - **Hugging Face**: Host the trained models on Hugging Face's platform, making them easily accessible for others and allowing for straightforward integration into other applications.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - **PyTorch** for model training and development.
  - **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization.
  - **Gradio** for building the user interface.
  - **Hugging Face** for model hosting and deployment.
